    <title> Ministry in North Kenya</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>OCFN Has an Effective Outreach Ministry in North Kenya</h1>
    <p>God opened our eyes to use the migrant manpower sitting idle in Nairobi to evangelize among the Borana of North Kenya. It is believed that 90% of the Borana population is still unreached. This vision made very good sense because we speak the same or very similar language. The Borana of Kenya and the Oromos of Ethiopia have a common anthropological background.

        We prayed for a long time to find a way to expand into North Kenya and the means to do it. After repeated failed attempts, we finally got a breakthrough in 2009 to the <a href="https://marsabit.go.ke/">marsabit count</a>, Dirib Gombo area, and started evangelizing in 2010.
        
         By 2022, we have planted 10 churches, are supporting over 12 pastors/evangelists, and have baptized over 5,000 new souls. We also assisted three evangelists to pursue a Bible college education, and they are currently serving their respective congregations.</p>
